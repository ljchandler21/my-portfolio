        <p>A first-person narrative exploration that tugs on the heartstrings.</p>

    <section class="game-body">
        <p><strong>When a letter from your&nbsp;recently deceased grandfather beckons&nbsp;you back to your family&nbsp;home in Silesia, you aren't sure what to expect. By exploring&nbsp;the space and the relics&nbsp;in it, learn the complicated past of a man you never fully knew. This is a story about hardship, tenacity, soul, and the people of Poland.</strong><br></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>This game was made for the <em>Dialogue of Civilizations: Poland in Pixels</em> program. It was developed over&nbsp;a span of four weeks as a joint effort between&nbsp;students of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw and&nbsp;Northeastern University in Boston. <strong>Please note that Silesia&nbsp;is intended to be a short and&nbsp;polished experience, with an expected playtime of 5-10 minutes.</strong></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>[Currently the quit to main menu button is broken and it is recommended to restart the game after each playthrough]</strong></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>The browser build has lower resolution of textures, but offers the same experience. It is not a demo version. Playing with sound on is strongly recommended. You can use "P" to pause if you are playing the web version.</strong></p>
