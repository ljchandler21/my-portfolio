        <h1>Amnesia</h1>

        <p>You and your team of explorers are researching a new treatment for
            Amnesia and other forms of memory loss - manual recovery through dreams.
            Your lead scientists have found a way for you to enter your patientsâ€™ dreams
            and extract the fragments of their memories by hand to piece together the full story
            of what has been forgotten and maybe discover things about each other along the way.</p>
